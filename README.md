# better-title-case [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bdougherty/better-title-case.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bdougherty/better-title-case)

> Convert a string to title case based on the [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/2008/05/title_case) rules.

## Rules

- If the string is all-caps, it will be corrected
- The following words are not capitalized by default: a, an, and, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, so, the, to, up, yet, v, v., vs, and vs.
- Words with capital letters other than the first are assumed to be capitalized properly and are skipped
-  It also skips any word that looks like a file path, file name, or URL
- The first and last word are always capitalized
- Sub-strings (those that are within quotes or parens/braces) are capitalized according to the same rules


## Installation

```
$ npm install --save better-title-case
```


## Usage

```js
const titleCase = require('better-title-case');
console.log(titleCase('Nothing to Be Afraid of?'));
// Nothing to Be Afraid Of?
```


## Advanced

You can configure `better-title-case` to add your own excluded words to the default list, or to prevent the use of the default list by passing a `config` object as the second parameter.

### excludedWords

Type: `Array`<br>
Default: `[]`

Additional words to exclude from capitalization.

```js
titleCase('Nothing to be afraid of?', {
    excludedWords: ['be']
});
// 'Nothing to be Afraid Of?'
```

### useDefaultExcludedWords

Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `true`

Disable the usage of the default list of excluded words.

```js
titleCase('Nothing to be afraid of?', {
	useDefaultExcludedWords: false
});
// 'Nothing To Be Afraid Of?'
```
